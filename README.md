# Validity Enhance Prediction

Predicting social science constructs like human values, digital trace data utilization becomes more popular in recent decades. However, it is challenging because it often contains measurement errors and the high-dimensional data is relative to the number of observations. In order to address the challenges, we propose two solutions. First, incorporating measurement models into the loss function of prediction models to mitigate measurement error. Second, utilizing an automatic selection method based on semantic similarity to handle high-dimensinal data.
